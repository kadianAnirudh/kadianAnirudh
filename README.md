After dedicating 3 years to Bachelors in Commerce and a few months in Marketing, I left everything to code. I have set myself on a 50 day challenge stretching between April 20 and June 10 where I am learning new technologies, creating projects and sharing my resources and journey with my fellow mates. Follow me on my Twitter, LinkedIn or Medium to join me on this challenge! 

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
